* Developing and simulating observing scenarios to optimize UVEX’s gravitational wave follow-up strategies.
* Optimizing target-of-opportunity observations to capture kilonova light curves within tight time constraints.
* Collaborating with teams to integrate UVEX follow-up strategies, enhancing detection of transient astrophysical events.
