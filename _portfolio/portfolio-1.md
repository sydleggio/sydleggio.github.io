* PI: Fiona Harrison, California Institute of Technology
* Advisor: Michael Coughlin, University of Minnesota

* Developing and simulating observing scenarios to optimize UVEXâ€™s gravitational wave follow-up strategies.
* Optimizing target-of-opportunity observations to capture kilonova light curves within tight time constraints.
* Collaborating with teams to integrate UVEX follow-up strategies, enhancing detection of transient astrophysical events.

* Senior Thesis: Optimizing ToO Strategy for Prospects of EM Follow-up To Gravitational Wave Events with UVEX
