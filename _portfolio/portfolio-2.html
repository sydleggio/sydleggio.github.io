PI: Patrick Kelly
* Led a UROP-funded project to synchronize telescope arrays, optimizing data distribution processes.
* Programmed Python scripts to enable TURBO’s detection and tracking of space objects in under 30 seconds.
* Enhanced the lab’s GitHub repository and utilized Linux to debug and resolve pipeline errors.
* Designed and implemented code that dynamically identified all space objects within TURBO’s field of view and tracked moving objects such as comets in real-time.
