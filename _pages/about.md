Welcome to my personal research website! I am currently a senior in astrophysics and physics at the University of Minnesota with a deep interest in black holes, gravitational waves, and multi-messenger astronomy. I am currently applying to physics PhD programs to further my research in the field. I founded Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS) at UMN in March 2022 and am still the current president of the professional student group. I am also a project manager for the IMPRESS and EXACT missions within the Small Satellite Research Laboratory. Feel free to email me at the address linked in the sidebar!
