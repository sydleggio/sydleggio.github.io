Welcome to my personal research website! I am a senior in astrophysics and physics at the University of Minnesota with a deep interest in black holes, gravitational waves, and multi-messenger astronomy. I will be pursuing a PhD in physics at the University of Southern California beginning this fall. Feel free to email me at the address linked in the sidebar!
